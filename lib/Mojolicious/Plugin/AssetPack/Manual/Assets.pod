Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Manual::Assets - How to define assets

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual will show you various ways to define assets with
L<Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack>.

=head1 DEFINING ASSETS

First you need to load the plugin. Here is an example lite app, which does
that:

  plugin "AssetPack";

=head1 Local assets

Here is the basic way of defining an asset:

  app->asset(
    "some-asset.js" => (
      "/js/foo.js",
      "/js/bar.js",
    )
  );

The "some-asset.js" string is just so you can refere to the genrated bundle
in your templates L<later|Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Manual::Include>,
while the list of files after (foo.js and bar.js) are files that exists in
one of the public L<static|Mojolicious/static> directories defined in your
application.

=head1 Online assets

The assets does not need to be locally. They can also be
L<fetched|Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack/fetch> online:

  app->asset(
    "bundle.js" => (
      "http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es5-shim/2.3.0/es5-shim.js",
      "http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es5-shim/2.3.0/es5-sham.js",
      "http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.js",
      "/js/myapp.js",
    )
  );

The code aboove will download three assets from web and combine them with
one asset defined locally.

NOTE! The online assets are cached locally, which means that they will not
be refreshed, unless you manually delete them.

=head1 NEXT

Now that you know how to define your assets, you can start using them in
your L<templates|Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Manual::Include>.
