NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack - Compress and convert css, less, sass,
    javascript and coffeescript files

VERSION
    0.37

SYNOPSIS
    In your application:

      use Mojolicious::Lite;

      plugin 'AssetPack';

      # define assets: $moniker => @real_assets
      app->asset('app.js' => '/js/foo.js', '/js/bar.js', '/js/baz.coffee');
      app->asset('app.css' => '/css/foo.less', '/css/bar.scss', '/css/main.css');

      # you can combine with assets from web
      app->asset('ie8.js' => (
        'http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es5-shim/2.3.0/es5-shim.js',
        'http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es5-shim/2.3.0/es5-sham.js',
        'http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.js',
        '/js/myapp.js',
      ));

      app->start;

    In your template:

      %= asset 'app.js'
      %= asset 'app.css'

    Or if you want the asset inlined in the HTML:

      %= asset 'app.css', { inline => 1 }

    You can also pass on attributes to the generated HTML tag:

      %= asset 'app.css', {}, media => "print,handheld,embossed"

    Or if you need to add the tags manually:

      % for my $asset (asset->get('app.js')) {
        %= javascript $asset
      % }

    See also "register".

DESCRIPTION
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack is a Mojolicious plugin which can be used
    to cram multiple assets of the same type into one file. This means that
    if you have a lot of CSS files (.css, .less, .sass, ...) as input, the
    AssetPack can make one big CSS file as output. This is good, since it
    will often speed up the rendering of your page. The output file can even
    be minified, meaning you can save bandwidth and browser parsing time.

    The core preprocessors that are bundled with this module can handle CSS
    and JavaScript files, written in many languages.

    See Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Preprocessors for more details.

  Production mode
    This plugin will compress sass, less, css, javascript and coffeescript
    with the help of external applications on startup. The result will be
    one file with all the sources combined. This file is stored in "Packed
    directory".

    The files in the packed directory will have a checksum added to the
    filename which will ensure broken browsers request a new version once
    the file is changed. Example:

      <script src="/packed/app-ed6d968e39843a556dbe6dad8981e3e0.js">

    This is done using "process".

  Development mode
    This plugin will expand the input files to multiple script or link tags
    which makes debugging and development easier.

    This is done using "expand".

    TIP! Make morbo watch your less/sass files as well:

      $ morbo -w lib -w templates -w public/sass

    You can also set the "MOJO_ASSETPACK_NO_CACHE" environment variable to 1
    to convert your less/sass/coffee files each time their asset directive
    is expanded (only works when "minify" is disabled).

  Inlined assets
    AssetPack is able to insert your assets directly into your markup. This
    is useful if you want to make a one-page app and want to keep the number
    of requests to the server at a minimum. However, the images, fonts or
    any other external asset which again is referred to require more
    requests to the server. See below on how to include the asset directly
    in your template:

      %= asset 'app.css', { inline => 1 }

    Or for manual inspection:

      % for my $data (asset->get('app.js', { inline => 1 })) {
        %== $data;
      }

  Custom domain
    You might want to serve the assets from a domain different from where
    the main app is running. The reasons for that might be:

    *   No cookies send on each request. This is especially useful when you
        use Mojolicious sessions as they are stored in cookies and clients
        send whole session with every request.

    *   More request done in parallel. Browsers have limits for sending
        parallel request to one domain. With separate domain static files
        can be loaded in parallel.

    *   Serve files directly (by absolute url) from CDN (or Amazon S3).

    This plugin support this if you set a custom "base_url".

ENVIRONMENT
  MOJO_ASSETPACK_DEBUG
    Set this to get extra debug information to STDERR from AssetPack
    internals.

  MOJO_ASSETPACK_NO_CACHE
    If true, convert the assets each time they're expanded, instead of once
    at application start (useful for development). Has no effect when
    "minify" is enabled.

ATTRIBUTES
  base_url
      $self = $self->base_url("http://my-domain.com/static/");
      $str = $self->base_url;

    This attribute can be used to control where to serve static assets from.
    it defaults to "/packed". See also "Custom domain".

    NOTE! You need to have a trailing "/" at the end of the string.

  fallback
      $self = $self->fallback($bool);

    Setting this attribute to true will enable the asset() helper to use
    bundled assets if the "process" step fail. asset() will still throw an
    error if there are no bundled assets available.

    The default value is "1" in production mode.

    This feauture is EXPERIMENTAL. Feedback wanted.

  minify
    Set this to true if the assets should be minified.

  preprocessors
    Holds a Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Preprocessors object.

  out_dir
    Holds the path to the directory where packed files can be written. It
    defaults to "mojo-assetpack-public/packed" directory in temp unless a
    static directory is writeable.

METHODS
  add
      $self->add($moniker => @rel_files);

    Used to define new assets aliases. This method is called when the
    "asset()" helper is called on the app.

  fetch
      $path = $self->fetch($url);

    This method can be used to fetch an asset and store the content to a
    local file. The download will be skipped if the file already exists. The
    return value is the absolute path to the downloaded file.

  get
      @files = $self->get($moniker);

    Returns a list of files which the moniker point to. The list will only
    contain one file if the $moniker is minified.

  preprocessor
      $self = $self->preprocessor($name => \%args);

    Use this method to manually register a preprocessor.

    See "SYNOPSIS" in
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Preprocessor::Browserify for example
    usage.

  process
      $self->process($moniker => @files);

    This method use "process" in
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Preprocessors to convert and/or minify
    the sources pointed at by $moniker.

    The result file will be stored in "Packed directory".

  register
      plugin AssetPack => {
        base_url => $str, # default to "/packed"
        minify => $bool, # compress assets
      };

    Will register the "compress" helper. All arguments are optional.

    "minify" will default to true if "mode" in Mojolicious is "production".
