NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack - Compress and convert css, less, sass,
    javascript and coffeescript files

VERSION
    0.12

SYNOPSIS
    In your application:

      use Mojolicious::Lite;

      plugin 'AssetPack';

      # define assets: $moniker => @real_assets
      app->asset('app.js' => '/js/foo.js', '/js/bar.js', '/js/baz.coffee');
      app->asset('app.css' => '/css/foo.less', '/css/bar.scss', '/css/main.css');

      # you can combine with assets from web
      app->asset('bundle.js' => (
        'http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es5-shim/2.3.0/es5-shim.js',
        'http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es5-shim/2.3.0/es5-sham.js',
        'http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.js',
        '/js/myapp.js',
      ));

      app->start;

    In your template:

      %= asset 'app.js'
      %= asset 'app.css'

    Or if you need to add the tags manually:

      % for my $asset (asset->get('app.js')) {
        %= javascript $asset
      % }

    See also "register".

ENVIRONMENT
  MOJO_ASSETPACK_NO_CACHE
    If true, convert the assets each time they're expanded, instead of once
    at application start (useful for development). Has no effect when
    "minify" is enabled.

DESCRIPTION
  Production mode
    This plugin will compress scss, less, css, javascript and coffeescript
    with the help of external applications on startup. The result will be
    one file with all the sources combined. This file is stored in "Packed
    directory".

    The files in the packed directory will have a checksum added to the
    filename which will ensure broken browsers request a new version once
    the file is changed. Example:

      <script src="/packed/app-ed6d968e39843a556dbe6dad8981e3e0.js">

    This is done using "process".

  Development mode
    This plugin will expand the input files to multiple script or link tags
    which makes debugging and development easier.

    This is done using "expand".

    TIP! Make morbo watch your less/sass files as well:

      $ morbo -w lib -w templates -w public/sass

    You can also set the "MOJO_ASSETPACK_NO_CACHE" environment variable to 1
    to convert your less/sass/coffee files each time their asset directive
    is expanded (only works when "minify" is disabled).

  Preprocessors
    This library tries to find default preprocessors for less, scss, js,
    coffee and css.

    NOTE! The preprocessors require optional dependencies to function
    properly. Check out "detect" in
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Preprocessors for more details.

    You can also define your own preprocessors:

      app->asset->preprocessors->add(js => sub {
        my($assetpack, $text, $file) = @_;
        $$text = "// yikes!\n" if 5 < rand 10;
      });

ATTRIBUTES
  minify
    Set this to true if the assets should be minified.

  preprocessors
    Holds a Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Preprocessors object.

  out_dir
    Holds the path to the firectory where packed files can be written. It
    defaults to "mojo-assetpack" directory in temp unless a static directory
    is writeable.

  rebuild
    Deprecated.

METHODS
  add
      $self->add($moniker => @rel_files);

    Used to define new assets aliases. This method is called when the
    "asset()" helper is called on the app.

  expand
      $bytestream = $self->expand($c, $moniker);

    This method will return one tag for each asset defined by the
    "$moniker".

    Will also run "less", "sass" or "coffee" on the files to convert them to
    css or js, which the browser understands. (With
    "MOJO_ASSETPACK_NO_CACHE" enabled, this is done each time on expand;
    with it disabled, this is done once when the asset is added.)

    The returning bytestream will contain style or script tags.

  get
      @files = $self->get($moniker);

    Returns a list of files which the moniker point to. The list will only
    contain one file if the $moniker is minified.

  process
      $self->process($moniker => @files);

    This method use "process" in
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Preprocessors to convert and/or minify
    the sources pointed at by $moniker.

    The result file will be stored in "Packed directory".

  register
      plugin 'AssetPack', {
        minify => $bool, # compress assets
        no_autodetect => $bool, # disable preprocessor autodetection
      };

    Will register the "compress" helper. All arguments are optional.

    "minify" will default to true if "mode" in Mojolicious is "production".
