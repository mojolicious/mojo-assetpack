          # source files used to create the asset

DESCRIPTION
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack is Mojolicious plugin for processing
    static assets. The idea is that JavaScript and CSS files should be
    served as one minified file to save bandwidth and roundtrip time to the
    server.

    There are many external tools for doing this, but integrating them with
    Mojolicious can be a struggle: You want to serve the source files
    directly while developing, but a minified version in production. This
    assetpack plugin will handle all of that automatically for you.

    Your application creates and refers to an asset by its topic (virtual
    asset name). The process of building actual assets from their components
    is delegated to "pipe objects". Please see "Pipes" in
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Tutorial for a complete list.

BREAKING CHANGES
  assetpack.db (v1.47)
    "assetpack.db" no longer track files downloaded from the internet. It
    will mostly "just work", but in some cases version 1.47 might download
    assets that have already been downloaded with AssetPack version 1.46 and
    earlier.

    The goal is to remove "assetpack.db" completely.

GUIDES
    * Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Tutorial

      The tutorial will give an introduction to how AssetPack can be used.

    * Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Developing

      The "developing" guide will give insight on how to do effective
      development with AssetPack and more details about the internals in
      this plugin.

    * Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Cookbook

      The cookbook has various receipes on how to cook with AssetPack.

HELPERS
  asset
      $self = $app->asset;
      $self = $c->asset;
      $bytestream = $c->asset($topic, @args);
      $bytestream = $c->asset("app.css", media => "print");

    "asset()" is the main entry point to this plugin. It can either be used
    to access the Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack instance or as a tag
    helper.

    The helper name "asset" can be customized by specifying "helper" when
    registering the plugin.

    See Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Tutorial for more details.

ATTRIBUTES
  minify
      $bool = $self->minify;
      $self = $self->minify($bool);

    Set this to true to combine and minify the assets. Defaults to false if
    "mode" in Mojolicious is "development" and true otherwise.

    See "Application mode" in
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Tutorial for more details.

  route
      $route = $self->route;
      $self = $self->route($route);

    A Mojolicious::Routes::Route object used to serve assets. The default
    route responds to HEAD and GET requests and calls serve_asset() on
    "store" to serve the asset.

    The default route will be built and added to the application when
    "process" is called the first time.

    See "ASSETS FROM CUSTOM DOMAIN" in
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Cookbook for an example on how
    to customize this route.

  store
      $obj = $self->store;
      $self = $self->store(Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Store->new);

    Holds a Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Store object used to locate,
    store and serve assets.

  tag_for
      $self = $self->tag_for(sub { my ($asset, $c, \%args, @attrs) = @_; });
      $code = $self->tag_for;

    Holds a sub reference that returns a Mojo::Bytestream object containing
    the markup required to render an asset.

    $asset is a Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Asset object, $c is an
    Mojolicious::Controller object and @attrs can contain a list of HTML
    attributes. %args currently contains:

    *   base_url

        See "ASSETS FROM CUSTOM DOMAIN" in
        Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Cookbook.

    *   topic

        Name of the current topic.

  ua
      $ua = $self->ua;

    Holds a Mojo::UserAgent which can be used to fetch assets either from
    local application or from remote web servers.

METHODS
  pipe
      $obj = $self->pipe($name);
      $obj = $self->pipe("Css");

    Will return a registered pipe by $name or "undef" if none could be
    found.

  process
      $self = $self->process($topic => @assets);
      $self = $self->process($definition_file);

    Used to process assets. A $definition_file can be used to define $topic
    and @assets in a separate file. See "Process assets" in
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Tutorial for more details.

    $definition_file defaults to "assetpack.def".

  processed
      $collection = $self->processed($topic);

    Can be used to retrieve a Mojo::Collection object, with zero or more
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Asset objects. Returns undef if $topic
    is not defined with "process".

  register
      $self->register($app, \%config);

    Used to register the plugin in the application. %config can contain:

    * helper

      Name of the helper to add to the application. Default is "asset".

    * pipes

      This argument is mandatory and need to contain a complete list of
      pipes that is needed. Example:

        $app->plugin(AssetPack => {pipes => [qw(Sass Css Combine)]);

      See "Pipes" in Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Tutorial for a
      complete list of available pipes.

    * proxy

      A hash of proxy settings. Set this to 0 to disable proxy detection.
      Currently only "no_proxy" is supported, which will set which requests
      that should bypass the proxy (if any proxy is detected). Default is to
      bypass all requests to localhost.

      See "detect" in Mojo::UserAgent::Proxy for more information.
