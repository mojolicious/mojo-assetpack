    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack - Compress and convert css, less, sass,
    javascript and coffeescript files

VERSION
    1.07

SYNOPSIS
  Application
      use Mojolicious::Lite;

      # Load plugin and pipes in the right order
      plugin AssetPack => {
        pipes => [qw(Less Sass Css CoffeeScript Riotjs JavaScript Combine)]
      };

      # define asset
      app->asset->process(
        # virtual name of the asset
        "app.css" => (

          # source files used to create the asset
          "sass/bar.scss",
          "https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/master/sass/materialize.scss",
        )
      );

  Template
      <html>
        <head>

      </html>

FOR EXISTING USERS
    Are you already using AssetPack? You can still do so without any change.
    This new version was written to make it easier to maintain and also
    easier to extend. The new code will be "activated" by loadind this
    plugin with a list of pipes:

      $app->plugin(AssetPack => {pipes => [...]});

    The old API will not be maintained and slowly deprecated.

DESCRIPTION
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack is Mojolicious plugin for processing
    static assets. The idea is that JavaScript and CSS files should be
    served as one minified file to save bandwidth and roundtrip time to the
    server.

    There are many external tools for doing this, but integrating them with
    Mojolicious can be a struggle: You want to serve the source files
    directly while developing, but a minified version in production. This
    assetpack plugin will handle all of that automatically for you.

    The actual processing is delegated to "pipe objects". Please see "Pipes"
    in Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Tutorial for a complete list.

GUIDES
    * Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Tutorial

      The tutorial will give an introduction to how AssetPack can be used.

    * Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Cookbook

      The cookbook has various receipes on how to cook with AssetPack.

ENVIRONNMENT
    It is possible to set environment variables to change the behavior of
    AssetPack:

    * MOJO_ASSETPACK_DEBUG

      Set this environment variable to get more debug to STDERR. Currently
      you can set it to a value between 0 and 3, where 3 provides the most
      debug.

OPTIONAL MODULES
    There are some optional modules you might want to install:

    * CSS::Minifier::XS

      Used by Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Pipe::CSS.

    * CSS::Sass

      Used by Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Pipe::Sass.

    * IO::Socket::SSL

      Required if you want to download assets served over SSL.

    * JavaScript::Minifier::XS

      Used by Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Pipe::JavaScript.

HELPERS
asset
      $self = $app->asset;
      $self = $c->asset;
      $bytestream = $c->asset($topic, @args);
      $bytestream = $c->asset("app.css", media => "print");

    "asset()" is the main entry point to this plugin. It can either be used
    to access the Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack instance or as a tag
    helper.

    The helper name "asset" can be customized by specifying "helper" when
    registering the plugin.

    See Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Tutorial for more details.

ATTRIBUTES
  minify
      $bool = $self->minify;
      $self = $self->minify($bool);

    Set this to true to combine and minify the assets. Defaults to false if
    "mode" in Mojolicious is "development" and true otherwise.

    See "Application mode" in
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Tutorial for more details.

  route
      $route = $self->route;
      $self = $self->route($route);

    A Mojolicious::Routes::Route object used to serve assets. The default
    route responds to HEAD and GET requests and calls serve_asset() on
    "store" to serve the asset.

    The default route will be built and added to the application when
    "process" is called the first time.

    See "ASSETS FROM CUSTOM DOMAIN" in
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Cookbook for an example on how
    to customize this route.

  store
      $obj = $self->store;
      $self = $self->store(Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Store->new);

    Holds a Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Store object used to locate,
    store and serve assets.

  ua
      $ua = $self->ua;

    Holds a Mojo::UserAgent which can be used to fetch assets either from
    local application or from remote web servers.

METHODS
  pipe
      $obj = $self->pipe($name);
      $obj = $self->pipe("Css");

    Will return a registered pipe by $name or "undef" if none could be
    found.

  process
      $self = $self->process($topic => @assets);
      $self = $self->process($definition_file);

    Used to process assets. A $definition_file can be used to define $topic
    and @assets in a seperate file. See "Process assets" in
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Tutorial for more details.

    $definition_file defaults to "assetpack.def".

  processed
      $collection = $self->processed($topic);

    Can be used to retrieve a Mojo::Collection object, with zero or more
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Asset objects. Returns undef if $topic
    is not defined with "process".

  register
      $self->register($app, \%config);

    Used to register the plugin in the application. %config can contain:

    * helper

      Name of the helper to add to the application. Default is "asset".

    * pipes

      This argument is mandatory and need to contain a complete list of
      pipes that is needed. Example:

        $app->plugin(AssetPack => {pipes => [qw(Sass Css Combine)]);

      See "Pipes" in Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Guides::Tutorial for a
      complete list of available pipes.

    * proxy

      A hash of proxy settings. Set this to 0 to disable proxy detection.
      Currently only "no_proxy" is supported, which will set which requests
      that should bypass the proxy (if any proxy is detected). Default is to
      bypass all requests to localhost.

      See "detect" in Mojo::UserAgent::Proxy for more infomation.
